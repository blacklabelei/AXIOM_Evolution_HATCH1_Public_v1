# AXIOM Recursive Coherence Implementation Notes

## Overview

AXIOM is designed around the principle of **Recursive Coherence**, enabling robust, scalable, and aligned reasoning by preserving semantic structure across multiple layers of recursive cognitive processing.

This document outlines:
- The Recursive Coherence Principle (RCP)
- The Functional Model of Intelligence (FMI) components
- AXIOM’s mapped architecture fulfilling RCP
- Why this approach is unique and foundational

## 1. What is Recursive Coherence?

Recursive Coherence ensures that as an AI recursively refines its thoughts, memory, or decisions, it preserves **semantic consistency** and **logical integrity**.

> “For any reasoning system composed of subsystems operating over conceptual levels, a recursively evaluable generalization operator must span and align lower-order conceptual spaces.” — *RCP (2025)*

---

## 2. Functional Model of Intelligence (FMI)

RCP-compliant systems must implement:

**Internal Functions**:
- Evaluation (E)
- Modeling (M)
- Adaptation (A)
- Stability enforcement (S)
- Decomposition (D)
- Bridging (B)

**External Functions**:
- Memory (long-term / short-term)
- Recall
- System 1 (fast intuition)
- System 2 (slow reasoning)

## 3. AXIOM’s Recursive Architecture Mapping

| FMI Function | AXIOM Module |
|--------------|-----------------------------|
| Evaluation   | `TemporalCognitiveProcessor` – stability collapse |
| Modeling     | `EntangledConceptGraph` + `RecursiveMemoryEngine` |
| Adaptation   | `PatternLearner` + recursive memory updates |
| Stability    | Timeline simulation + memory pruning |
| Decomposition| `SymbolicLayer` parse → transform pipeline |
| Bridging     | Neuro-symbolic mapping, NLP ↔ logic |
| Memory       | `RecursiveMemoryEngine`, `HolographicMemory` |
| Recall       | `resonance_collapse()` pattern-based retrieval |
| Sys 1        | Pattern heuristics (direct path) |
| Sys 2        | Symbolic reasoning pipeline + delayed reflection |

AXIOM cycles through these functions recursively per event, preserving conceptual coherence across sessions and threads.

## 4. Why It Matters

Recursive Coherence is **not** just a design feature—it’s the **structural guarantee** that AXIOM:

- Won’t hallucinate as LLMs do at recursion depth
- Remembers context semantically, not just textually
- Can simulate future branches and align past behavior
- Enables explainable, modular intelligence that scales

---

## 5. Strategic Positioning

AXIOM is the **first public implementation** of Recursive Coherence in an assistive, neuro-symbolic ADA-compliant system.

This foundational design provides:
- **IP defensibility**
- **Long-term architectural integrity**
- **Human-aligned cognition at scale**
